\chapter{Introduction} \label{chapter1:introduction}

For the past several decades, the primary focus in nuclear engineering within
the United States has been on light water reactors (LWR). Commercially,
all nuclear reactors are either boiling water reactors (BWR) or pressurized
water reactors (PWR). Correct computation of the thermal hydraulics within the
reactor core leads to efficient design and accuracy in the safety analysis. A
popular subchannel code for modeling the hydrodynamics within the reactor core
is CTF, which is a subchannel thermal-hydraulics code developed from
COBRA-TF \cite{Salko2014}. This FORTRAN based code solves 8 conservation
equations for liquid, entrained droplet, and vapor phases phases, plus one
conservation equation for non-condensable gases. A 1-D residual formulation of
the code has been created for single phase liquid coupled to radial conduction.
While other residual formulations have been formed for other versions of
COBRA-TF \cite{Lloyd2014}, none have been integrated into the CASL version of
CTF. A large portion of this work focues on the verification of both the
residual formulation and the original version of CTF for the single phase liquid
and radial conduction equations. The current version of CTF has standard
verification practices that focus on software quality engineering similar to
those in other versions of COBRA-TF \cite{Aumiller2013}, but currently lacks an
in depth verification document that focuses on numerical algorithm verification.
This work focues on this second type of verification for the residual
formulation and original versions of CTF. The verificaiton problems will study
of the order of accuracy of the errors, which considered one of the more
rigorous verification criteria \cite{Roy2005}. This work will be
considered a starting point for future work to perform verificaiton
on the single phase equations in both axial and transverse dimensions
\cite{Merroun2009}, and coupled multiphysics \cite{Mahadevan2009}.
